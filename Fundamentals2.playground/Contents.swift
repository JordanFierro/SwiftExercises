//  Exercise 1: Declaring and Unwrapping Optionals
//  Declare an optional string variable named nickname that initially has no
//  value. Then assign a value and safely unwrap it with an if let statement to
//  print it.

// Write your code below:





// Exercise #2: Create a class `Person` with an optional property `nickname`. Then instantiate a `Person` and use optional chaining to print the nickname if it exists.

// Write your code below:





// Exercise #3: Implicitly Unwrapped Optionals
// An implicitly unwrapped optional is a type of optional that you assume will always have a value after it's first set.
// Below, define a Dog class with a name property and an implicitly unwrapped optional property nickname.
// Then, instantiate a Dog object with and without a nickname, and demonstrate how you might access the nickname.
// In your comments, discuss why using an implicitly unwrapped optional could be beneficial and what risks it might pose.

// Write your code below:






// Exercise #4: Type Casting w/ Optionals
//  Create an array of different types (Int, String, Double) as [Any], then write a function that iterates over the array and prints the type and value of each element using optional casting.

// Write your code below:



// Exercise #5: Advanced Optional Handling with guard
// Create a Cat class that includes a method that uses 'guard let' to safely unwrap the nickname

// Write your code below:
